## Script

### LoadBalancer

> On cloud providers which support external load balancers, setting the type field to LoadBalancer provisions a load balancer for your Service. The actual creation of the load balancer happens asynchronously, and information about the provisioned balancer is published in the Serviceâ€™s .status.loadBalancer field.

*-Kubernetes-[Service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/)*

```plaintext
helm install dev load-balancer
```

Observe; including NodePort. The way this works, is that the Nodes are configured to listen on the NodePort and route traffic to the Service Endpoints.

```plaintext
kubectl get all

kubectl describe service eample-dev
```

Observe AWS Classic LoadBalancer.  In particular the Instances and Listeners.

### LoadBalancer (HTTPS)

The AWS specific solution involves:

1. Obtaining a custom domain name, e.g., using AWS Route 53

2. Create a SSL/TLS certificate using AWS Certificate Manager

3. Create a LoadBalancer using a configuration

4. Mapping the custom domain name to the LoadBalancer, e.g., using AWS Route 53

Kubernetes provides documentation on the specific configurations for each of the [Cloud Providers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/cloud-providers).

```plaintext
helm install dev load-balancer-ssl
```
