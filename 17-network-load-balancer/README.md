## Script

### LoadBalancer

> On cloud providers which support external load balancers, setting the type field to LoadBalancer provisions a load balancer for your Service. The actual creation of the load balancer happens asynchronously, and information about the provisioned balancer is published in the Serviceâ€™s .status.loadBalancer field.

*-Kubernetes-[Service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/)*

```plaintext
helm install dev load-balancer
```

Observe; including NodePort. The way this works, is that the Nodes are configured to listen on the NodePort and route traffic to the Service Endpoints.

```plaintext
kubectl get all

kubectl describe service eample-dev
```

Observe AWS Classic LoadBalancer.  In particular the Instances and Listeners.
