## Script

First a disclaimer...  These videos were made as part of my preparation for the CKA certification exam.

The material is organizied around the official curriculum:

[Open Source Curriculum for CNCF Certification Courses](https://github.com/cncf/curriculum)

This tutorial is very different than your typical K8s tutorial, e.g.:

[Tutorials](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/)

Those tutorial get to the "fun stuff", e.g., Pods, containers, etc, at the start.  This is more appropriate for a first taste of K8s.

This tutorial, however, starts with more of the fundamentals, e.g., cluster topology, authentication, etc. The thinking here is that you already know you want to learn K8s.

While the official curriculum provided the organization, the bulk of the content comes from the K8s concepts section.

[Concepts](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/)

Finally, there are also a number of K8s preparation course available (most were around $300 or so) that you might find valuable. Without naming names, I was fairly unsatisfied with the one that I took and thus was born this tutorial (I needed more hands on practice).
